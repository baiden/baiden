# Y'ello ✌🏽,

I'm a superfan of the little green bot. Conversely, I ocassionally find myself staring at the cloud too. I'm currently exploring better ways to _bake_ useful things with **Android** and **Google Cloud**. Maybe I might peep at ML in the future too.

In my spare time, I like help out with the dev community, dive into music or enjoy some good jokes on [twitter](https://twitter.com/samueletsiakoh).
